# To-Do-List

<p> I made a to-do list that allows the user to add items to the to do list, view items in the to-do list, delete items from the to do list and exit the application. I think I made it pretty accessible for anyone to use. I tried to account for errors the user could make when entering information into the system. I think overall it is fairly straightforward to use. Thank you. </p>
