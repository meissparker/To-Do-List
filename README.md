# To-Do-List

<p> I made a to-do list that allows the user to add items to the to do list, view items in the to-do list, delete items from the to do list and exit the application. I think I made it pretty accessible for anyone to use. I tried to account for errors the user could make when entering information into the system. To add items the user needs to enter the number 1 from the main menu and then type the item they would like to add when prompted. To view the to do list the user needs to type 2 in the main menu and then they will be shown all the items that they have added to the to do list. To delete an item, the user needs to press 3 in the main menu and then enter the name of the task they would like to delete when prompted. To exit the application, the user needs to press 4 in the main menu, after which they will be thanked for using the app and the application will end. Thank you. </p>
